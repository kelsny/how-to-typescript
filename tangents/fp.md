##  Is Type Abuse a Good Way to Learn Functional Programming

Short answer: f\*ck no.

Even if it has some of the same concepts and ideas, it's definitely not a good way to learn functional programming.
To be perfectly blunt, it's just enough difference that type abuse is not an effective way to properly learn common patterns and rules in functional programming.

For clarity, it's not that type abuse is not a bad way, it's just that type abuse is not a great way.
You can *still* apply some concepts from type abuse (recursion, state management, logic) to functional programming, it's just definitely not recommended.

So yeah. Learn Haskell properly.
