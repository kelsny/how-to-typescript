# How to type magic

> People always ask, "How do you do your type magic stuff?", so I'm going to try and answer them.

### Foreword

Ok, first I'd like to admit not everyone says "How do you do your type magic stuff?".
Sometimes they give me a weird quizzical look and say, "What the f\*ck is the use of this?".
Well the use is a great challenge for your logic and method for practicing actually useful TypeScript skills.
Useful? Where'd that come from? 
It's useful because if you can do type magic, you can apply your type magic to real-world scenarios!
You'll see later throughout this book when we apply a new idea, concept, or pattern to something that might be used in production.

Second, I'm definitely not that good at type magic.
To be quite honest, most of the time I just grab whatever sh\*t I can think of to solve a problem and throw it in to see if it does something remotely similar to what I want.
I'd like to think I'm pretty good but then I go to [Type Challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/issues) and...

It's too painful to talk about.
